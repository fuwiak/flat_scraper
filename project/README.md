# Patodeweloperka

(_pl. patodeweloperka - pathologically small apartments sold for an exorbitant 
price e.g. 16m<sup>2</sup> "flat"_)  

A scraper written in Python that collects flats advertisements and regularly 
checks for their price changes. Even though a threshold for 
"ridiculously small" area of a flat is not agreed on, I am going to say it's
less than 30m<sup>2</sup>.



### What I am looking for

I will check prices for **buying** and **renting** such flats.

- price of the apartment
- location (district)
- the size of the apartment (in m<sup>2</sup>)
- number of rooms
- number of bathrooms
- does it have a garage
- type of the property (flat / house)
- description

### Aim of the project
1. Learn web scraping
2. Do something productive during the pandemic
3. Expose the scale of the problem in Poland. Maybe. (Too ambitious? We'll see)
